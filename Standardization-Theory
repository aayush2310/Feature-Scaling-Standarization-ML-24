//Also called Z-score Normalization//

let there be given a column of age which i will transform to age'.
x(i)'=(x(i)-mean)/standard deviation
So now the new column age' will have mean as 0 and standard deviation as 1.

Geometrically->We plot the graph of age Vs salary of 500 people
  We did two things:-
    i)We did mean centric i.e. we moved our origin to the mean of the data points i.e x coordinate is the mean of age and y coordinate is the mean of salary
    ii)The SD is 1 so we squeezed the data points in the new coordinate axes towards 1 which were farther than 1 distance and spread those data points which were less than 1 distance from the origin.
