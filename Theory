//Last step of Feature Engineering//
//Easy step//
//Most imp. tech of feature scaling-standarization//
//Feature scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present int the data in a fixed range//
//Why Feature Scaling??-->Told earlier-(KNN)

Types of feature Scaling-
1)Standarization
2)Normalization
  a)Min-Max Scalar
  b)Robust Scalar(Works good on outliers)
