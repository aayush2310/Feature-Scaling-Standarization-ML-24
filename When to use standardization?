Apply standardization on the following algorithms for sure:-
1)K-Means=>Use the Euclidian distance measure
2)K-Nearest Neighbour=>Measure the distances between pairs of samples and these distances are influenced by the measurement units
3)Principal Componenet Analysis(PCA)=>Try to get the feature with maximum variance
4)Artificial Neural Network=>Apply Gradient Descent
5)Gradient Descent=>Theta calculation becomes faster after feature scaling and the learning rate in the update equation of Stachastic Gradient Descent is the same for every parameter.
